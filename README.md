# Used_Car_Price_Prediction
Problem Statement
The used car market is complex, with numerous factors influencing a car's resale value, such as manufacturer reputation, age, mileage, engine specifications, power output, kilometers driven, and seating capacity. Accurately predicting used car prices can empower buyers and sellers to make informed decisions. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that analyzes historical sales data to estimate the market value of used cars, enhancing pricing strategies and negotiations.

Solution Approach
To predict used car prices, a comprehensive dataset of historical car sales is used. The approach involves several steps:

Data Collection:

Gather a dataset with features affecting car prices, including:
Manufacturer
Age of the car
Mileage
Engine specifications
Power
Kilometers driven
Number of seats
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values through imputation.
Convert categorical features into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Normalize or standardize numerical features for improved model performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze the dataset to identify trends and relationships between features and car prices.
Visualize data to gain insights into feature distributions and correlations with the target variable (car price).
Model Selection:

Split the dataset into training and testing subsets.
Experiment with various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, CatBoost) to find the best-performing model based on metrics like RÂ² score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Model Training:

Train the selected model using the training dataset.
Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize performance.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model on the testing dataset using appropriate metrics.
Ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.
